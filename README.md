ADjDM is a rough effort to create a tray app, providing IT support departments with basic functionality on testing Active Directory joined devices health, including:

- User (Password Health, Password Strength, AD User Info, Local Admin Check)
- Computer (Domain Trust Health, Windows Health, Disks Health, System Info, Software Info)
- Services (Time Service, Windows Update Health, Events List)
- Policies (List Applied Policies, Folder Redirection Health, USB/CD Policy, Encryption Policy)

Destined to run on Windows 10 devices, with absolute basic UI, to execute above tests.
